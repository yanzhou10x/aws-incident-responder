# AWS Incident Detecter

### Resources
- [Flaws2 Defender Track](http://flaws2.cloud/defender.htm)

### Algorithm
- Load cloudtrail log data into pandas.dataframe.
- Fetch IAM roles in target account.
- Join log data with IAM roles on ARN.
- For each row in joined dataset, check source IP address if it's within AWS IP range. 

### Python Implementation
- https://github.com/yanzhou10x/aws-incident-responder/tree/master/src
- To run:
  - ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python defender.py
    ```
- Result:

### Athena queries
- How many events are there for each kind of event?
  - ```sql
    SELECT eventname AS event_name,
           count(*) AS event_count
    FROM flaws2.cloudtrail
    GROUP BY eventname
    ORDER BY event_count DESC
    ```

- What percentage of events are errors?
  - ```sql
    SELECT count(*)*100.0/(SELECT count(*) FROM flaws2.cloudtrail) AS event_error_percentage
    FROM flaws2.cloudtrail
    WHERE errorcode IS NOT NULL;
    ```

- For each distinct User Identity Account ID, what is the mean time between events?
  - ```sql
    WITH events AS 
      (SELECT useridentity.accountid AS account_id,
              min(eventtime) OVER (PARTITION BY useridentity.accountid) AS min_event_timestamp, 
              max(eventtime) OVER (PARTITION BY useridentity.accountid) AS max_event_timestamp, 
              count(*) OVER (PARTITION BY useridentity.accountid) AS event_count
      FROM flaws2.cloudtrail
      WHERE useridentity.accountid IS NOT NULL)
    SELECT DISTINCT account_id,
          DATE_DIFF('second', from_iso8601_timestamp(min_event_timestamp), from_iso8601_timestamp(max_event_timestamp))*1.0/(event_count-1) AS mean_interval_in_second
    FROM events
    ```
